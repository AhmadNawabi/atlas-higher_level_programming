This repository contains examples and resources for using jQuery, a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library, to simplify web development.

## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in use today.

## Getting Started

To start using jQuery in your web projects, you can include it from a CDN or download it and include it locally in your project. Here's how you can include jQuery from the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

Or download it from the jQuery website and include it in your HTML:

<script src="path/to/jquery.min.js"></script>
